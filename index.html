            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a student of Computer Engineering at York University's Lassonde School of Engineering. I am a persistent, dedicated person who has developed skills in teamwork, leadership, communication, and project management through coursework and extracurricular experiences. I have an excellent understanding of applications for sustainable development and working with people to improve the world we live in.</p>
            <p>I am very passionate about playing guitar, a hobby I have enjoyed since I was 5 years old. I love reading articles by the philosopher Dr. Daisaku Ikeda, biking with friends, tasting new dishes, and playing with Arduinos. Additionally, I enjoy sports, particularly basketball and tennis.</p>
            <p>Over the past year, I have also started working as a part-time graphic designer and photographer, offering my services free of charge to local realtors and events in my area. This has been a rewarding experience as I enjoy giving back to the community and helping those around me.</p>
